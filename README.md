# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to Catbook Version 2.0!

This is a React app for all cat lovers to document their favorite feline friends.
You can view all your cats and add new ones as well using the form.
You can run npm start in your terminal to open this app, and then host db.json on a mock server to run the backend.

Have fun poking around the site!
